    "Answer the following questions in written form:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the volume (i.e., how loud a sound is) reflected in analog and digital audio signals?\n",
    "\n",
    "In analog signals, volume is represented by different pressure values over time, while in digital signals volume is represented as amplitude.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Why does it make sense to perform non-uniform quantization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Quantization stores samples linearly. If storage is important, non-uniform quantization is better since it uses non uniform quantization levels which are more suited to the frequencies that humans hear best.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Why do WAV files require more storage space than MP3 files?\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, WAV is a lossless compression method while MP3 is a lossy one. This automatically means the size of the first one will be bigger than the second one. WAV contains the original data that was converted from analog to digital. MP3 uses psychoacoustics in the compressing process so that unimportant data is reduced in favor of smaller storage size: frequencies that cannot be heard by human hearing are removed, sounds that are masked by other sounds are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the physical appearance of sound and how it is converted to digitally sampled audio. Explain how sampling works and the meaning of the terms amplitude, sampling frequency, and quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is a wave shaped signal. Through digitization of an analog signal, the signal is converted to a digital signal (a series of bits). The sound wave is considered to be 1 dimensional: pressure of sound (amplitude) changes in time, time being the only independent variable. The pressure over time is a continuous variable so it has infinite values, which is why it needs to be transformed into discrete values by sampling when we digitize it. To digitize the signal, sampling in both dimensions - time (\"sampling\") and amplitude (\"quantization\") - is required.\n",
